# ML Project Lab

ML Project Lab is a collection of hands-on machine learning and deep learning projects built to understand real-world problem solving using data.

Each project in this repository follows a complete end-to-end workflow:
- Problem understanding
- Data preparation
- Model building
- Training and evaluation
- Output analysis using proper metrics
- Final inference or prediction

The goal of this lab is not just to build models, but to understand:
- why each step is required
- what problems occur during implementation
- how outputs and metrics should be interpreted in practice

Projects are organized as independent subfolders, each with its own code, outputs, and documentation.
